Some Views on the Making and Use Characteristics of Automatic Doors in Hospital Wards

The wheelchairs, stretchers and drug carriers almost enter and exit the ward every day, inevitably knocking, touching, scratching wooden doors and doorframes. The doors and jackets will be damaged to varying degrees after the project is put into use for a short time. The longer the time, the more serious the damage. The phenomenon of "breaking the door of a new building" which we often call "breaking the door of a new building" has appeared. Because of the particularity of the use of ward doors, their use characteristics should be satisfied in the process of design and manufacture.

Aluminum alloy profiles are used to seal all doors, door pockets and doorways. Compared with traditional paint door edge sealing and PVC edge sealing, its advantages are as follows:

1. Wooden doors with good edge sealing quality have no effect on edge sealing quality when they absorb (expand) and drain (shrink).

2. It has good anti-knock and anti-scratch performance. Because all the aluminum alloy edges are wrapped with angle, 90 degrees around doors, door pockets and doorways are wrapped, even if knocking and scratching, there will be no scratch, pitting or scratch at wood edges and corners. It fundamentally solves the problem of edge and corner breakage in the use process.

3. Maintain the water balance of the wood inside the door and cover; because the edge is tightly sealed and the edges and corners are not damaged, there is no local imbalance of moisture absorption and drainage. Always maintain the moisture content (gradient water balance) of the wood in the product when it is in the factory state. Even for seasonal reasons or when central air conditioning is on, indoor temperature and relative humidity will change. Doors and sleeves can also expand and contract in a balanced state.

4. After installation, the overall effect is good. Because of the use of wrapping angle and integral edge sealing, there is no improper installation of seams, black lines and other phenomena. The edge sealing of each part is integrated, horizontal and vertical.

5. The disadvantage of aluminium alloy edge sealing: high cost.
